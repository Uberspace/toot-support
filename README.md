# toot support

A web tool to handle customer service or support via mastodon. It treats
mentions, DMs and hashtags as incoming tickets to be looked at, replied to
and/or closed.

It currently only links to socialhub.io, but can be extended to provide an
independent interface or push to any other platform.
